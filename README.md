# Network-Sniffer
In this project, you will develop a basic network sniffer using Python and the Scapy library. A network sniffer is a tool that captures network packets from a specified network interface and analyzes their contents. 


Project Overview:
In this project, you will develop a basic network sniffer using Python and the Scapy library. A network sniffer is a tool that captures network packets from a specified network interface and analyzes their contents. This project will give you hands-on experience in working with network protocols, packet structures, and low-level network traffic analysis.

Features:
Packet Capture:
Your network sniffer will capture packets from a specified network interface in real-time.

Packet Analysis:
The sniffer will analyze captured packets to extract information like source and destination IP addresses, protocols, source/destination ports, and flags for TCP packets.

Packet Logging:
Implement packet logging to save captured packets to a file for later analysis.

Filtering:
Add the ability to filter packets based on protocols or port numbers to capture only the packets of interest.

Packet Payload:
Display and log the payload of packets for a deeper analysis.

User Interface (Optional):
Create a simple command-line user interface that allows the user to control the sniffer, set filtering options, and display captured packets in real-time.

Duration Control (Optional):
Allow the user to set a time limit for packet capturing, so the sniffer stops after a specified duration.
