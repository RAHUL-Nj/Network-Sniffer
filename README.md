# Advanced Network Packet Sniffer


Project Overview:

The "Advanced Network Packet Sniffer" project aims to develop a versatile and powerful network packet capturing and analysis tool. This tool will allow users to monitor, capture, filter, and analyze network traffic on a specified network interface. It is designed to be a valuable asset for network administrators, security analysts, and developers for various network-related tasks, including troubleshooting, security monitoring, and performance analysis.

Project Features:

Real-time Packet Capturing:
The tool should continuously capture network packets on a specified network interface.

Protocol and Port Filtering:
Users should be able to filter packets based on specific network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP) and ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP). Filtered packets should be displayed and logged.

Source and Destination IP Filtering:
Users should have the option to filter packets based on source and destination IP addresses.

Packet Analysis:
The tool should analyze each packet, extract key information such as source and destination IPs, protocol, port numbers, flags (for TCP packets), and payload. This information should be displayed in a user-friendly manner.

Packet Timestamps:
Include a timestamp for each captured packet to track when it was captured.

Export Captured Packets:
Allow users to export the captured packets to a PCAP (Packet Capture) file format. PCAP files can be opened and analyzed using tools like Wireshark.

Log Rotation:
Implement log rotation to manage log file size. Create new log files at regular intervals and archive old ones.

Packet Decoding:
Decode packet payloads for specific application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, FTP) and display relevant information such as URLs, hostnames, or file transfers.

Real-time Alerting:
Implement real-time alerting for specific events or anomalies, such as the detection of malware patterns or intrusion attempts. Alerts should be displayed or logged.

IP Geolocation:
Use IP geolocation databases to determine the geographic location of IP addresses in captured packets. Display this information alongside captured packets.

Packet Count and Statistics:
Provide statistics on the number of packets captured, categorized by protocol, and display these statistics periodically.

User-Friendly Interface:
Design a user-friendly command-line or graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring and interacting with the sniffer tool.

Implementation and Tools:-
. Python:
Use Python as the programming language.
. Scapy:
Utilize the Scapy library for packet sniffing, analysis, and manipulation.
. PCAP Export:
Implement PCAP export using the Scapy library.
. IP Geolocation:
Integrate an IP geolocation service or database for geographical information.
. Real-time Analysis:
Implement real-time packet analysis using Python scripts.
. User Interface:
Create a command-line or GUI interface for user interaction and configuration.
. Security and Ethical Considerations:


Project Milestones:-

1. Design and architecture of the network packet sniffer.
2. Implement continuous packet capturing on the specified network interface.
3. Add protocol and port filtering functionality.
4. Incorporate source and destination IP filtering.
5. Real-time packet analysis and decoding.
6. Implement timestamping and log rotation.
7. Add PCAP export feature.
8. Include IP geolocation for IP addresses.
9. Develop a user-friendly interface.
10. Test and debug the tool.
11. Ethical considerations and documentation.


Ensure that the tool is used responsibly and legally. Packet sniffing without proper authorization is unethical and potentially illegal.
Clearly communicate the purpose and usage of the tool to the users.
Respect privacy and data protection regulations.
